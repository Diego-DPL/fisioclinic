## Project Overview
This is a React application built with Vite for fast development and optimal performance.

## Development Guidelines
- Use modern React patterns including hooks and functional components

- Implement responsive design principles
- Prioritize component reusability and clean code structure
- Use TypeScript when adding new files for better type safety

## Project Structure
- `src/` - Source code directory
- `src/components/` - Reusable React components
- `src/pages/` - Page-level components
- `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions
